## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

var name = "Dmitrii"
print("A person can change his/her name and then it will have to be changed in the application")
var age = 20
print("Age increases every year")
var numberOfStepsTakenToday = 9801
print("The number of steps increases with each step taken and can be changed after the declaration")
var goalNumberOfSteps = 12000
print("The goal for the steps can also be changed every day")
var averageHeartRate = 76
print("Average heart rate can vary from day to day")

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
